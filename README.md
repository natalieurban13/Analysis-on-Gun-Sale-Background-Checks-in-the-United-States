# Udacity Analysis on Gun Sale Background Checks in the United States

## Overview
This was my first project within Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree. I learned how to wrangle, clean, explore, and analyze a dataset. I analyzed gun permit
checks within the United States from the year 1998 to 2017. I asked three main questions on this dataset and explored the data with them. I created 
visualizations to help display my analysis. 


## Software Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebooks
- Pandas
- Numpy
- MatPlotLib
- Seaborn

## Files
- gun_data.csv

## Questions Analyzed
- What amount of the total background checks each year are from handguns?
- What are the top 5 states in total background checks? How have they compared over the years?
- Which state has the highest redemption rate checks on all weapons?
